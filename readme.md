This follow the [Kubebuilder book](https://book.kubebuilder.io).

Step-by-step table of contents:
- [Architecture](architecture.md) - https://book.kubebuilder.io/architecture
- [Quick start](quick-start.md) - https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start
- [My quick start](my-quick-start.md) - Previous quick start was full of theory, here I will design own Custom Resource and show only the steps made by me to register such Custrom Resource in my cluster and build its simple controller.
